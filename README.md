# Remastered TicTacToe game!

This game was created as a school project in computer science.
The goal was to create a tic-tac-toe game that has an editable grid size and a flexible gameplay (two game modes available).
- The first game mode, called 'TicTacToe mode', is pretty much like the original game, the first player that creates an alignment wins the game.
- The second game mode, called 'Max score mode', consists of maximizing the score, one aligment provides 1 additional point.
