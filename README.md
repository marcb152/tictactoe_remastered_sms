# Remastered TicTacToe game! (WIP)

This game was created as a school project in computer science.
The goal was to create a tic-tac-toe game that has an editable grid size and a flexible gameplay (two game modes available).
The first game mode, called 'TicTacToe mode', is pretty much like the original game, the first player that creates an alignment wins the game.
The second game mode, called 'Max score mode', consists of maximizing the score, one aligment provides 1 additional point.
